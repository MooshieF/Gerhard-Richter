            <p>Born in 1932 in the former East Germany, the artist Gerhard Richter spent his first thirteen years 
            under National Socialist rule in the German Democratic Republic. As a painter, he studied for 16 years 
            under the East German Communist regime with its 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">Socialist Realism </a> art, 
            followed by nearly half a century of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_realism">Capitalist Realism </a> in the West. 
            </p>
            
            <p>For almost six decades, Gerhard Richter has been one of the world's most significant artists. 
            He has been called our best living painter.
            </p>
         
            <p>Although Richter originally trained and worked in a very realistic style, his technique has evolved over the years.
            Throughout his extremely prolific career, he has continued to use his own painting to explore 
            how images that appear to capture "truth" 
            often prove to be far less objective, or unsure in meaning, than originally assumed. 
            The other common themes in his work are the elements of chance, and the play between 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"> realism </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art"> abstraction </a>. 
            </p>
         
            <p>Richter's work often explores the power of the captured image and painting's 
            troubled relationship with photography. Neither can claim to express reality truthfully, 
            but can suggest only an incomplete view of a subject. 
            </p>
         
            <p>Inspiration for his paintings often come from newspaper photographs, as well as his own family albums. 
            He often starts by projecting one of these photos onto his canvas. 
            Richter uses this technique to illustrate how images often take on a life of their own, 
            like elusive spirits that haunt our dreams.
            He frequently paints detailed under-paintings on which he then considers and reflects upon for some time. It is an unusual process
            considering that up to 90% of the original work may be covered by subsequent layers of paint once it is complete. 
            By merging photography, projection, and painting in his art, his work
            suggests that all vision is a kind of conversion of the real into the imaginary.

            <p>Gerhard Richter's work is full of tension between depicted reality and the actuality of painting. 
            His paintings consistently support a dual and unified theme: <br> </p>
            <p>Images are static, superficial, and untrustworthy.</p>
            <p>Reality is a process of imagination, creation and revision. Using his art, 
            Richter constantly finds new ways to explore and express the range of relationships between illusion and reality.
